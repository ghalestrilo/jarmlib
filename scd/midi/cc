0	Bank Select	Allows user to switch bank for patch selection. Program change used with Bank Select. MIDI can access 16,384 patches per MIDI channel.
1	Modulation	Generally this CC controls a vibrato effect (pitch, loudness, brighness). What is modulated is based on the patch.
2	Breath Controller	Often times associated with aftertouch messages.
3	Undefined	 
4	Foot Controller	Often used with aftertouch messages. It can send a continuous stream of values based on how the pedal is used.
5	Portamento Time	Controls portamento rate to slide between 2 notes played subsequently.
6	Data Entry Most Significant Bit(MSB)	Controls Value for NRPN or RPN parameters.
7	Volume	Control the volume of the channel
8	Balance	Controls the left and right balance, generally for stereo patches. 0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
9	Undefined	 
10	Pan	Controls the left and right balance, generally for mono patches. 0 = hard left, 64 = center, 127 = hard right
11	Expression	Expression is a percentage of volume (CC7).
12	Effect Controller 1	Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth/workstation.
13	Effect Controller 2	Usually used to control a parameter of an effect within the synth/workstation.
14	Undefined
15	Undefined
16 – 19	General Purpose	 
20 – 31	Undefined	 
32 – 63	Controller 0-31 Least Significant Bit (LSB)	 
64	Damper Pedal / Sustain Pedal	On/Off switch that controls sustain. (See also Sostenuto CC 66) 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
65	Portamento On/Off Switch	On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
66	Sostenuto On/Off Switch	On/Off switch – Like the Sustain controller (CC 64), However it only holds notes that were “On” when the pedal was pressed. People use it to “hold” chords” and play melodies over the held chord. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
67	Soft Pedal On/Off Switch	On/Off switch - Lowers the volume of notes played. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
68	Legato FootSwitch	On/Off switch - Turns Legato effect between 2 subsequent notes On or Off. 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
69	Hold 2	Another way to “hold notes” (see MIDI CC 64 and MIDI CC 66). However notes fade out according to their release parameter rather than when the pedal is released.
70	Sound Controller 1	Usually controls the way a sound is produced. Default = Sound Variation.
71	Sound Controller 2	Allows shaping the Voltage Controlled Filter (VCF). Default = Resonance - also(Timbre or Harmonics)
72	Sound Controller 3	Controls release time of the Voltage controlled Amplifier (VCA). Default = Release Time.
73	Sound Controller 4	Controls the “Attack’ of a sound. The attack is the amount of time it takes forthe sound to reach maximum amplitude.
74	Sound Controller 5	Controls VCFs cutoff frequency of the filter.
75	Sound Controller 6	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
76	Sound Controller 7	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
77	Sound Controller 8	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
78	Sound Controller 9	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
79	Sound Controller 10	Generic – Some manufacturers may use to further shave their sounds.
80	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
81	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
82	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
83	General Purpose MIDI CC Controller	Generic On/Off switch 0 to 63 = Off, 64 to 127 = On
84	Portamento CC Control	Controls the amount of Portamento.
85 – 90	Undefined	 
91	Effect 1 Depth	Usually controls reverb send amount
92	Effect 2 Depth	Usually controls tremolo amount
93	Effect 3 Depth	Usually controls chorus amount
94	Effect 4 Depth	Usually controls detune amount
95	Effect 5 Depth	Usually controls phaser amount
96	(+1) Data Increment	Usually used to increment data for RPN and NRPN messages.
97	(-1) Data Decrement	Usually used to decrement data for RPN and NRPN messages.
98	Non-Registered Parameter Number LSB (NRPN)	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
99	Non-Registered Parameter Number MSB (NRPN)	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the NRPN parameter.
100	Registered Parameter Number LSB (RPN)	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the RPN parameter.
101	Registered Parameter Number MSB (RPN)	For controllers 6, 38, 96, and 97, it selects the RPN parameter.
102 – 119	Undefined	 MIDI CC 120 to 127 are “Channel Mode Messages.”
120	All Sound Off	Mutes all sounding notes. It does so regardless of release time or sustain. (See MIDI CC 123)
121	Reset All Controllers	It will reset all controllers to their default.
122	Local On/Off Switch	Turns internal connection of a MIDI keyboard/workstation, etc. On or Off. If you use a computer, you will most likely want local control off to avoid notes being played twice. Once locally and twice whent the note is sent back from the computer to your keyboard.
123	All Notes Off	Mutes all sounding notes. Release time will still be maintained, and notes held by sustain will not turn off until sustain pedal is depressed.
124	Omni Mode Off	Sets to “Omni Off” mode.
125	Omni Mode On	Sets to “Omni On” mode.
126	Mono Mode	Sets device mode to Monophonic.
127	Poly Mode	Sets device mode to Polyphonic.
